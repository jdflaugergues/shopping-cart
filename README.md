This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the shopping cart project.


## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to run this project. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.


## Download the project

Clone this repo.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jdflaugergues/shopping-cart
cd shopping-cart
```


## Install npm packages

> See npm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
```

> If an error occurred during npm install, throw the `npm install` command again. 


## Run the application

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.

```shell
npm start
```

The browser will launch automatically with the app.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
